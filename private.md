This page isn't actually private its just documents I share with people that doesn't make sense to be broadcasted (Crazy Easter egg ikr). Like I don't really care if it gets out in the world. All assets are stored in private folder. Also I got github pro with student in order to host this privately lol. And no it's not in the sitemap. If u found this then ggs. Also, the link ref only really works in local mode since it's statically hosted so have fun link hunting!

If you can find a document or way to access them that someone hasn't shown me I will give you a Knuth reward check of $2.56.
